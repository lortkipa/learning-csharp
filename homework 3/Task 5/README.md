There are three positive integers: A, B, and C. The program should
ask the user to enter the values of these numbers. The greatest possible
number of squares with a side of C is arranged in a rectangle with the
size of A*B. The squares do not overlap each other. Find the number of
the squares placed in the rectangle and the area of the unused part of
the rectangle. It is necessary to provide service messages in case no
squares with the side of C can be placed inside a rectangle (for example,
if the value of C is larger than the sides of the rectangle).
